## Student:
Hi, I am currently getting an error. How do I fix it? Is it because I am not getting the name input properly from the java arguement?

## TA:
Hi Charlie. You're on the right track. Looking at your code, which methods have access to the command line arguments? Is there a way to access the arguments in your code?

## Student:
Thanks so much! I realized that I needed to pass the array to my method as an argument. I also realized that my arguement index was incorrect. Here is my revised code.
